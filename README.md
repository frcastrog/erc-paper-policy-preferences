## Abstract

An increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is
sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that
could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is
especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not
aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs
predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the
most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and
international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using
original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a
predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity
rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws
provide little information in predicting future repression, their
patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts
worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties.

## How to download and replicate

You can either [download the compendium as a ZIP
file](/archive/master.zip) or use GitHub to clone or fork the compendium
repository (see the green “Clone or download” button at the top of the
GitHub page).

We use the [**renv**
package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to create a
stable version-specific library of packages, and we use the [**targets**
package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to manage all file
dependencies and run the analysis. ([See this for a short helpful
walkthrough of
**targets**.](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html)).

To reproduce the findings and re-run the analysis, do the following:

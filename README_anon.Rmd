## Abstract

This research note investigates how political figures and social influences shape individual policy preferences. Specifically, it revisits the model proposed by @barber2018 and @barber2023 regarding Donald Trump's impact on people's liberal or conservative stances toward a set of policy issues in surveys fielded during Trump's presidency. We explore whether Trump's influence persists post-presidency as well as whether an additional significant factor in the contemporary social media age may also affect policy views, namely the opinion of a close friend. Results indicate that Trump and a close friend's cues do not affect policy support and have a limited effect when examining specific policies, such as taxes, immigration, and background checks. These findings contribute to existing research by demonstrating the waning influence of a prior President no longer in office, as well as the negligible effect of the alternative influence of a hypothetical close friend as measured in our survey experiment. We conclude by outlining additional ways in which the potential close friend effect could be investigated in future research.

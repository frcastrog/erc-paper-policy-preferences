README for Replication Data: "Does Issue Importance Attenuate Partisan Cue-Taking?”

Persons wishing to replicate the figures should focus on the first three files listed below.  In a self-contained way the figures can be replicated from these files.  To replicate tables and calculated results, you should use  the STATA files (the final two files listed).

Please contact Jeremy C. Pope (jpope@byu.edu) or Michael Barber (mbarber83@gmail.com) with questions.
